## Terminal Help

If you are stuck at any point, there are some commands to help you.

Each command begins with tutorial. Possible commands are:

 - `t01`         : go to the 1st practical directory
 - `t02`         : go to the 2nd practical directory
 - `t03`        : go to the 3rd practical directory
 - `thelp`       : display this message
 - `thome`       : go back to the tutorial main directory
 - `treadme`     : open the readme.html file, in case you close it.

There are also two HALucinator commands available, that you will use 
during this tutorial. They are:

```
halucinator-symtool
halucinator-rehost
```

The second one is something you will use inside of run.sh.

In the terminal, you can see where you are with the command pwd. You can 
list the directory you are in with ls. You can change to any directory with 
cd. You might also like to know:

```
python3 myfile.py   # runs that script with python.
./myscript.sh       # runs a bash script.
```

If you get stuck, don't forget to ask for help, and likewise, please 
ask questions!
