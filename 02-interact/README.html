<p><a href="../README.html">Back</a></p>
<p>This section picks up where the last section ended. Instead of just interacting with the firmware through basic commands, we will create a simple shell, allowing the analyst to play with the firmware and explore it further.</p>
<p>After setting up a firmware, such basic interaction is the first step an analyst would do to get an overview of what features the firmware provides. The analyst will hook several devices to probe different I/O capabilities and then play with the discovered functionalities.</p>
<p>Here, luckily, we’re only interacting through the UART so only need to expand that interaction.</p>
<h2 id="setup-initialization">Setup / Initialization</h2>
<p>We don’t need to go through the initialization of HALucinator and the device again. Simply run the local <code>copy.sh</code> script to copy over files we worked on during the first part of the tutorial:</p>
<pre><code>./copy.sh</code></pre>
<p>To copy your setup from the first part into this part. Note that you can run <code>./copy-cheat.sh</code> if you want to bootstrap with the provided solution of the first part.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-custom-shell-to-interact-with-the-firmware">Building a custom shell to interact with the firmware</h2>
<p>Our goal for this part of the tutorial is to build I/O capabilities and enable the analyst to play with the emulated firmware.</p>
<p>For this, we need to build a small shell that can fire off events to trigger the main functions of the firmware. We need some parsing for input from the command line that is then packaged up and sent to the emulated firmware.</p>
<p>We already learned about the <code>UartPeripheral</code> object and how to define callback functions that fire when the device returns data. This allows us to communicate bidirectionally: <code>send_line</code> to send data to the device and adjusting the callback function to handle received data.</p>
<p>In Python, we can read input lines (and print them to stdout) as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="cf">for</span> line <span class="kw">in</span> sys.stdin:</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="bu">print</span>(line)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As a first step, modify <code>extdev.py</code> to simply send the commands read from stdin to the firmware and display anything the firmware returns.</p>
<p>Does the <code>message_received</code> function need any improvement? What about the <code>UartPeripheral</code> class itself?</p>
<p>Your friendly co-worker told you that the firmware accepts the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>version</li>
<li>status</li>
<li>login</li>
<li>cert</li>
</ul>
<p>Try them. How do they work with your tool?</p>
<p>Next, this is a highly secure IoT device. The username and password are <code>admin</code> and <code>123456</code>. Can you automatically send these to the device?</p>
